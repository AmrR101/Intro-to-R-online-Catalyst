#### Selecting using indices with logical operators

We can also use indices with logical operators. Logical operators include greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (==). A full list of logical operators in R is displayed below:

| Operator | Description |
| :-----------:|:----------------|
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal to|
| < | less than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| & | and |
| \| |or |

We can use logical expressions to determine whether a particular condition is true or false. For example, let's use our age vector: 
	
```r
age
```

If we wanted to know if each element in our age vector is greater than 50, we could write the following expression:	

```r
age > 50
```

Returned is a vector of logical values the same length as age with TRUE and FALSE values indicating whether each element in the vector is greater than 50.

```r
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

We can use these logical vectors to select only the elements in a vector with TRUE values at the same position or index as in the logical vector.

Select all values in the `age` vector over 50 **or** `age` less than 18:

```r
age > 50 | age < 18

age

age[age > 50 | age < 18]  ## nested

# OR

## create a vector first then select
idx <- age > 50 | age < 18
age[idx]
```

##### Indexing with logical operators using the `which()` function

While logical expressions will return a vector of TRUE and FALSE  values of the same length, we could use the `which()` function to output the indices where the values are TRUE. Indexing with either method generates the same results, and personal preference determines which method you choose to use. For example:

```r
which(age > 50 | age < 18)

age[which(age > 50 | age < 18)]  ## nested

# OR

## create a vector first then select
idx_num <- which(age > 50 | age < 18)
age[idx_num]
```

Notice that we get the same results regardless of whether or not we use the `which()`. Also note that while `which()` works the same as the logical expressions for indexing, it can be used for multiple other operations, where it is not interchangeable with logical expressions.

### Factors

Since factors are special vectors, the same rules for selecting values using indices apply. The elements of the expression factor created previously had the following categories or levels: low, medium, and high. 

Let's extract the values of the factor with high expression, and let's using nesting here:

```r
expression[expression == "high"]    ## This will only return those elements in the factor equal to "high"
```

> **Nesting note**: 
>
> The piece of code above was more efficient with nesting; we used a single step instead of two steps as shown below:
> 
> Step1 (no nesting): `idx <- expression == "high"`
>
> Step2 (no nesting): `expression[idx]`


***
**Exercise**

Extract only those elements in `samplegroup` that are not KO (*nesting the logical operation is optional*).

#### Releveling factors

We have briefly talked about factors, but this data type only becomes more intuitive once you've had a chance to work with it.  Let's take a slight detour and learn about how to **relevel categories within a factor**. 

To view the integer assignments under the hood you can use `str()`:

```r
expression

str(expression)
Factor w/ 3 levels "high","low","medium": 2 1 3 1 2 3 1
```
The categories are referred to as "factor levels". As we learned earlier, the levels in the `expression` factor were assigned integers alphabetically, with high=1, low=2, medium=3. However, it makes more sense for us if low=1, medium=2 and high=3, i.e. it makes sense for us to "relevel" the categories in this factor.

To relevel the categories, you can add the `levels` argument to the `factor()` function, and give it a vector with the categories listed in the required order:

```r
expression <- factor(expression, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"))     # you can re-factor a factor 

str(expression)
Factor w/ 3 levels "low","medium",..: 1 3 2 3 1 2 3
```

Now we have a releveled factor with low as the lowest or first category, medium as the second and high as the third. This is reflected in the way they are listed in the output of `str()`, as well as in the numbering of which category is where in the factor.

> Note: Releveling becomes necessary when you need a specific category in a factor to be the "base" category, i.e. category that is equal to 1. One example would be if you need the "control" to be the "base" in a given RNA-seq experiment.

***
**Exercise**

Use the `samplegroup` factor we created in a previous lesson, and relevel it such that KO is the first level followed by CTL and OE.
